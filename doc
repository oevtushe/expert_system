dependencies list contains dependencies with root as dep.node
    and question as elem in dep.facts list
for each dependency in dependencies list
    rlist <- Empty
    for each fact in dependency.facts
        rlist += all rules with fact in right hand side (rhs)
    for each rule in rlist
        if rule is already in the graph
            add node containing the rule as children to dependency.node
            continue
        create new node with rule as data
        add created node as children to dependency.node
        create new dependency with above node and empty facts list
        for every fact in left hand side (lhs) of rule
            if fact is not resolved
                add fact to facts list in created dependency
        if created dependency facts list is not empty
            add created dependency to dependencies list

traverse built graph with dfs and resolve each visited node
